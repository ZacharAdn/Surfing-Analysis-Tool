# Surfing Movement Analysis - Project Development Stages

## Stage 1: Data Understanding & EDA + Annotation Tool
- **Annotation Tool Development**: Video player interface with multi-surfer support
- **Manual Labeling**: Mark start/end times for each surfer's ride
- **Bounding Box Tool**: Crop relevant areas around each surfer
- **Data Organization**: Apply annotations to video collection
- **Basic Analysis**: Ride duration statistics and visual pattern discovery

## Stage 2: Baseline Model Development
- **Simple Feature Extraction**: Basic pose detection (center of mass, board angle)
- **Binary Classification**: Predict "successful ride" vs "wipeout" from frames
- **Time-based Labeling**: Use time on wave until fall/closure as success metric
- **Basic ML Models**: Start with Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- **Performance Evaluation**: Establish baseline accuracy metrics

## Stage 3: Model Enhancement
- **Sequential Modeling**: LSTM/RNN for movement sequences over time
- **Advanced Features**: Body angle changes, weight distribution, timing patterns
- **Movement Prediction**: Predict optimal next movement from current position
- **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune models for higher accuracy
- **Feature Engineering**: Create more sophisticated movement indicators

## Stage 4: Simple Application
- **Streamlit App**: Upload video â†’ automatic analysis interface
- **Key Outputs**: 
  - Ride duration prediction
  - Movement quality scoring
  - Improvement suggestions
- **Dashboard**: Movement patterns and success correlations visualization
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple upload and results display

## Success Metrics
- **Primary Target**: Time on wave (seconds) until fall or wave closure
- **Secondary Metrics**: Movement quality scores, prediction accuracy
- **Application Goal**: Actionable feedback for surfer improvement
